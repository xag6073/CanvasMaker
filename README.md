# Canvas Maker

Manage, edit, and save multiple drawing canvases. 

> **Note**: This was largely developed in 24 hours for BrickHack X. It represents my first experience with HTML and CSS.

## Directions

* Start by creating a file; you can rename or delete the new file by right clicking on it.

* Once the file is opened select either of tools above (pen, eraser, highligher, line, color, save). Or press C to clear the canvas.

  * Keyboard shortcuts: 1 - Pen, 2 - Eraser, 3 - Highligher, 4 - Line, S - save.
 
* Once saved, to leave the opened file, simply click "Show Files" at the top right. Don't forget to save!

## About

As noted, this project was largely done to teach me the basics of html interfaces.

If I were to do it differently now, I would probably use Node.js to send seperate files and manage persistence. Rather than everthing being bundled together.

While it was a learning process, it was an enjoyable experience from start to finish!
